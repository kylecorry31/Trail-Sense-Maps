# Trail Sense Maps
An offline maps companion app for Trail Sense

Not much here yet - but I want a maps app that integrates nicely with Trail Sense.
- You should be able to open a Trail Sense beacon directly from the TS Maps app and start navigation to it
- TS should detect whether TS Maps is installed, and allow opening beacons in this app
- You should be able to place a beacon in TS Maps and have it appear in TS
- You should have an option in TS to create a beacon from TS Maps


Features (WIP)
- Select regions to download / manage downloaded maps (use OSM terrain / street maps)
- Navigate to beacons (requires TS to be installed)
- Navigate to points on the map
- (potential) Search for locations to navigate to
- Orient the map using the compass
- Navigate to nearest {freshwater source (river, lake, pond, stream), civilization (road, business, public building), peak (to get a better view of surroundings)}
- (potential) Provides information about your current biome
- (potential, maybe not possible) Download prevailing wind maps
